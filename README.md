## Install dependencies 

In order to run the project, you need to install _UV_ first.

On Linux and MacOS environments, launch the following command:

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.5.6/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows environments, launch the following command.

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.5.6/install.ps1 | iex"
```

After _UV_ has been installed, you are ready to install project dependencies:

```shell
uv sync 
```
